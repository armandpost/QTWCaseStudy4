## Abstract
The purpose of this case study is to examine one of two applications: Signal Frontier Analysis or Future Contract Rolling application. This case study focuses on the Signal Frontier Analysis application utilizing the Sharpe Ratio in order to create a momentum protfolio.

Signal processing techniques are extremely popular in equity and commodities trading strategies. Also called technical analysis, these signal processing methods disregard and often outperform fundamental valuation methods such as buying and selling securities based on a price to earnings ratio. Instead, technical analysis uses historical data to make bets on the future of stock prices given key assumptions. We empirically analyze strategies for one technical analysis method: momentum investing, which uses a stock's trend over a certain lookback period to signal to the investor whether to buy or sell. We find that intermediate term momentum investing strategies result in the highest return.

Signal Frontier analysis is an econometric technique which uses regression analysis to estimate stock prices over a period of time. Signal Frontier analysis allows us to analyze a basket of securities in order to find the optimal holding and look-back periods that would yield the highest Sharpe ratio. This practice is known as backtesting which utilizes different algorithms and portfolios that are compared to the overall study portfolio. This analysis can be used to help manage portfolios and determine whether their additional allocation of assests improves the risk-return of the stock.
